This project is a simple and interactive **Add to Cart** interface built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It simulates a basic e-commerce cart system, allowing users to select items from a list and add them to a cart dynamically.

### Features

* **Product Listing**
  A predefined list of products (iPhones) is displayed with associated prices and an "Add to Cart" button.

* **Add to Cart Functionality**
  Users can add any product to the cart. Each item is stored in a local array and displayed in the cart section dynamically using JavaScript.

* **Dynamic Cart Display**
  The cart updates in real-time as items are added. When the cart is empty, a placeholder message is shown.

* **Clear Cart Option**
  A "Clear Cart" button allows users to remove all items from the cart at once. After clearing, the cart display resets to its default message.

* **Responsive Layout**
  The layout is organized using Flexbox to neatly display the product list and cart side by side.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML** – To define the structure of the item and cart sections.
* **CSS** – For styling containers, buttons, and layout design, including hover effects.
* **JavaScript** – For managing item data, handling user interactions, dynamically rendering cart contents, and manipulating the DOM.
